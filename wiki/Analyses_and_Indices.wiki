#summary Table of available analyses and indices

This is a summary of the analyses and indices available in Biodiverse.  It is the same information available through the analysis selection tree visible in the Spatial and Cluster tabs, but also includes other details such as which indices can be used as a cluster metric.

This replaces the analyses_and_indices.html file in the documentation folder of the Biodiverse distributions.
