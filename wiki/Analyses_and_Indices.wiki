= Analyses and indices available in Biodiverse =

Most of the headings are self-explanatory.  For the others:
  * The *Subroutine* is the name of the subroutine used to call the function if you are using Biodiverse through a script.  
  * The *Index* is the name of the index in the SPATIAL_RESULTS list, or if it is its own list then this will be its name.  These lists can contain a variety of values, but are usually lists of labels with some value, for example the weights used in an endemism analysis.  The names of such lists typically end in "LIST", "ARRAY", "HASH" or "LABELS". 
  * *Valid cluster metric* is whether or not the index can be used as a clustering metric.  A blank value means it cannot.
  * The *Minimum number of neighbour sets* dictates whether or not an analysis will be run.  If you specify only one neighbour set then all those that require two sets will be dropped from the analysis.  This is always the case for spatial analyses applied to cluster nodes as there is only one neighbour set.  Note that many of the analyses lump neighbour sets 1 and 2 together.  For more details on neighbour sets, see the SpatialConditions page.
