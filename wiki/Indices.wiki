#summary Table of available indices

= Indices available in Biodiverse =
_Generated GMT Fri Jan  1 22:36:51 2010 using build_indices_table.pl, Biodiverse version 0.13._


This is a listing of the indices available in Biodiverse, ordered by the calculations used to generate them.
It is generated from the system metadata so is identical to that visible in the GUI.

Most of the headings are self-explanatory.  For the others:
  * The *Subroutine* is the name of the subroutine used to call the function if you are using Biodiverse through a script.  
  * The *Index* is the name of the index in the SPATIAL_RESULTS list, or if it is its own list then this will be its name.  These lists can contain a variety of values, but are usually lists of labels with some value, for example the weights used in an endemism calculation.  The names of such lists typically end in "LIST", "ARRAY", "HASH" or "LABELS". 
  * *Valid cluster metric* is whether or not the index can be used as a clustering metric.  A blank value means it cannot.
  * The *Minimum number of neighbour sets* dictates whether or not a calculation or index will be run.  If you specify only one neighbour set then all those calculations that require two sets will be dropped from the analysis.  (This is always the case for calculations applied to cluster nodes as there is only one neighbour set, defined by the set of groups linked to the terminal nodes below a cluster node).  Note that many of the calculations lump neighbour sets 1 and 2 together.  See the SpatialConditions page for more details on neighbour sets.

Note that calculations can provide different numbers of indices depending on the nature of the !BaseData set used.
This currently applies only to the [#Hierarchical_Labels Hierarchical Labels].

The number of indices generated depends on how many axes are used in the labels. In this case there are 2. Axes are numbered from zero, so level 1 results include all levels

 === Sorenson ===

*Description:* Sorenson dissimilarity between two sets of labels. It is the complement of the (unimplemented) Czechanowski index, and numerically the same as Whittaker's beta.

 === Taxonomic overlap ===

*Description:* Calculate taxonomic overlap metrics between the two sets of elements. Uses deviation from zero for variances. In most cases the means and variances will be the same. Bears some relation to Rao's quadratic entropy after modification to weight by sample counts. It is best to apply these using a small neighbour set 1 relative to a large neighbour set 2
