= Indices available in Biodiverse =
_Generated GMT Mon Oct 11 00:00:05 2010 using build_indices_table.pl, Biodiverse version 0.15._


This is a listing of the indices available in Biodiverse,
ordered by the calculations used to generate them.
It is generated from the system metadata and contains all the 
information visible in the GUI, plus some addtional details.

Most of the headings are self-explanatory.  For the others:
  * The *Subroutine* is the name of the subroutine used to call the function if you are using Biodiverse through a script.  
  * The *Index* is the name of the index in the SPATIAL_RESULTS list, or if it is its own list then this will be its name.  These lists can contain a variety of values, but are usually lists of labels with some value, for example the weights used in an endemism calculation.  The names of such lists typically end in "LIST", "ARRAY", "HASH" or "LABELS". 
  * *Valid cluster metric* is whether or not the index can be used as a clustering metric.  A blank value means it cannot.
  * The *Minimum number of neighbour sets* dictates whether or not a calculation or index will be run.  If you specify only one neighbour set then all those calculations that require two sets will be dropped from the analysis.  (This is always the case for calculations applied to cluster nodes as there is only one neighbour set, defined by the set of groups linked to the terminal nodes below a cluster node).  Note that many of the calculations lump neighbour sets 1 and 2 together.  See the SpatialConditions page for more details on neighbour sets.

Note that calculations can provide different numbers of indices depending on the nature of the !BaseData set used.
This currently applies to the hierarchically partitioned endemism calculations (both [#Endemism_central_hierarchical_partition  central] and [#Endemism_whole_hierarchical_partition whole]) and [#Hierarchical_Labels hierarchical labels].

==Hierarchical Labels==
 
 

 
  ===Ratios of hierarchical labels===
 
*Description:*   Analyse the diversity of labels using their hierarchical levels.
The A, B and C scores are the same as in the Label Counts analysis (calc_label_counts)
but calculated for each hierarchical level, e.g. for three axes one could have
A0 as the Family level, A1 for the Family:Genus level,
and A2 for the Family:Genus:Species level.
The number of indices generated depends on how many axes are used in the labels.
In this case there are 2.  Axes are numbered from zero
as the highest level in the hierarchy, so level 0 is the top level
of the hierarchy.

  ===Taxonomic overlap===
 
*Description:*   Calculate taxonomic overlap metrics between the two sets of elements.
Uses deviation from zero for variances.  In most cases the means and variances will be the same.

It is best to apply these indices using a small neighbour set 1 relative to a large neighbour set 2.
