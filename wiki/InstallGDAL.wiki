#summary Notes for the installation of GDAL on Ubuntu
= Introduction =

These are notes for the installation of Geo::GDAL on Ubuntu.  

The latest GDAL package can be obtained from https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ppa

These commands will add that repo to the apt-get list:
{{{
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa 
sudo apt-get update
}}}


The following extra libs need to be installed:
{{{
libarmadillo-dev
libpoppler-dev
libepsilon-dev
liblzma-dev
}}}


Compilation might need to go through the normal  steps.  Download and uncompress the tarball (maybe using cpanm).  Then in the relevant folder (editing the config path to point to bin/gdal-config):
{{{
perl Makefile.PL --no-version-check --gdal-config=/path/to/gdal-config
make
make test
make install
}}}
