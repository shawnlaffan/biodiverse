#summary Linux source code install instructions

These instructions apply to version 0.14.

Note that they have been tested on Ubuntu.  The package manager will differ for other Linux flavours, but the cpan command will be the same.

These also assume you have saved the Biodiverse source code to your home directory.  If you have not then change the `$HOME/biodiverse/lib` in the following to the appropriate directory.

This will require some interaction when it downloads additional packages, depending on your CPAN settings.  

{{{
#  get the glade package (this will also get the Gtk, Glib etc.)
sudo apt-get install glade

sudo perl -MCPAN -Mlib=$HOME/biodiverse/lib -e 'install Bundle::Biodiverse'

}}}

If you don't like the current window theme then you can change them using the Desktop Preferences (also via the `gnome-appearance-properties` tool).

You can download and install more themes from http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2
