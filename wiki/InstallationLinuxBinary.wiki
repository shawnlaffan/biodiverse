#summary Linux binary executable install instructions
#sidebar Installation

These instructions apply to version 0.14.

= Installation =

  *  Unzip the Biodiverse zip file to your hard drive.  The following assumes you have unzipped it so $HOME/biodiverse is the top level.  If you use a different path then modify the commands as appropriate.

= Running it =

  *  Biodiverse can be run by double clicking on `BiodiverseGUI_linux`.
  *  If you want to keep the command log visible after you close Biodiverse then run it from an xterm.
    *  In the xterm, type `$HOME/biodiverse/BiodiverseGUI_linux`.
  *  If you want to avoid all the typing then edit your profile to add the biodiverse directory to your $PATH environment variable.

= Troubleshooting and changes =

  *  Ensure that you have installed the latest `GTK+`, `Glade` and `GnomeCanvas` packages.

  *  If you don't like the current window theme then you can change them using the Desktop Preferences (also via the `gnome-appearance-properties` tool).  You can download and install more themes from http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2

  *  The Linux executable is a generated using the !ActiveState !PerlApp tool and does not use the accompanying source code.
