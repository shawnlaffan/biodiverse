#summary Linux source code install instructions
#sidebar Installation

These instructions apply to version 0.15 and later.

Note that they have been tested on Ubuntu.  The package manager will differ for other Linux flavours, but the cpan command will be the same.

These also assume you have [http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/downloads/list downloaded] the Biodiverse source code to your home directory and renamed it from `biodiverse_0.15_source` to `biodiverse`.  If you have saved it somewhere else then change the `$HOME/biodiverse/lib` in the following to the appropriate directory.


= Installation =

This will require some interaction when it downloads additional packages, depending on your CPAN settings.  

{{{
#  get the glade, canvas and gtk-perl packages (this will also get the Gtk, Glib etc.)
sudo apt-get install glade
sudo apt-get install libgnomecanvas2-0
sudo apt-get install libgtk2-gladexml-perl

sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::BiodiverseNoGUI'
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Biodiverse'
}}}

If you don't like the current window theme then you can change them using the Desktop Preferences (also via the `gnome-appearance-properties` tool).

You can download and install more themes from http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2

= Running it =

  * To run Biodiverse, open a terminal window and change directory to the biodiverse/bin folder.  If it is in your home folder and called `biodiverse` then type:
{{{
cd ~/biodiverse/bin
}}}
  * Once you have done this, type the following command to open Biodiverse.
{{{
perl BiodiverseGUI.pl
}}}
  *  Alternately, you could give the full path to Biodiverse if you want to start in a particular directory (i.e. where all your files are).
{{{
perl ~/biodiverse/bin/BiodiverseGUI.pl
}}}
  *  If you want your command prompt back after opening Biodiverse then run it as a background job.  However, the log output will then be mixed with any other commands you type.
{{{
perl BiodiverseGUI.pl &
}}}
  

  * You can also add the `biodiverse/bin` folder to your PATH variable to save some typing. You might also need to edit the shebang line in BiodiverseGUI.pl to point to the correct perl executable.

= Troubleshooting =
  *  Ubuntu 11 appears to need this before running the other installer commands:  `sudo apt-get install libgnome2-canvas-perl`
  *  Please report any other issues using the [http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/issues/list project issue tracker]
