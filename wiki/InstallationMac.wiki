#summary Macintosh source code install instructions

These instructions apply to version 0.14.

They have been tested on Snow Leopard, so there might be small changes for Leopard.

You will need Administrative privileges to run the installation.  

Note that this can take quite some time.  If you have not previously installed Xcode or !MacPorts then it could take several hours.  It will also download a large number of files, so make sure you have network access with good bandwidth and large download limits.

== Installation ==

  *  These instructions assume you have extracted the Biodiverse folders into your home directory.  If not then change the `$HOME/biodiverse/lib` text in the following for the folder path you have used (i.e. if it is in `/opt/biodiverse` then use `/opt/biodiverse/lib`).

  *  Install the Xcode software, as it is needed to compile the !MacPorts libraries.  This requires registration with Apple.  The download is also >2GB, of which a large part of which is the iPhone SDK which we don't need.  http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html

  *  Install MacPorts unless you already have it.  If you are not sure then install it anyway and it will tell you.
    * If your operating system is Snow Leopard then use http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.8.1-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg
    * If your operating system is Leopard then use http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.8.1-10.5-Leopard.dmg
    * (If needed, the generic !MacPorts URL is http://www.macports.org ).
    * Double click on the dmg file contents to install.  This will produce a folder called `opt` on your hard drive which has the components needed to perform the remaining steps.
  *  Run this command in a terminal window to get the latest versions of the !MacPorts libraries.
{{{
sudo port -v selfupdate
}}}

  *  Now install the perl libraries needed by Biodiverse.  The following commands will require some interaction when it downloads additional packages, depending on your CPAN settings.  The first two steps install the perl wrappers for Glade and Gnome Canvas and will also install all the other necessary libraries on which they depend (this will take a while).  The third installs the remaining perl libraries.
{{{
sudo port install p5-gtk2-gladexml
sudo port install p5-gnome-canvas

sudo /opt/local/bin/perl -MCPAN -Mlib=$HOME/biodiverse/lib -e 'install Bundle::Biodiverse'
}}}

== Trouble shooting ==

  *  If Perl complains that it cannot locate a file when running Biodiverse then this library will need to be installed using `cpan`. The complaint will look like _Can't locate Fred/Fred.pm in @INC (@INC contains:...)_ In this case, install module Fred::Fred (substitute a double colon "::" for each forward slash "/", and remove the trailing ".pm" from the module it cannot locate).
  *  !MacPorts might also complain that files are out of sync, probably if you have an existing !MacPorts installation.  If this is the case then run this command to ensure all files are up to date.
