#summary Windows binary executable install instructions

These instructions apply to version 0.14.

= Installation =

  *  Unzip the Biodiverse zip file to your hard drive.  The following assumes you have unzipped it to C:\biodiverse.  If you use a different path then modify the commands as appropriate.

= Running it =

  *  Biodiverse can be run by double clicking on `C:\biodiverse\Biodiverse_win.exe`.
  *  If you want to keep the command log visible after you close Biodiverse then run it from a command prompt.
    *  Under `Start Menu -> Run` type `cmd`.  
	*  In the resulting command window, type `C:\biodiverse\biodiverse_gui.exe`.


= Troubleshooting and changes =

  *  If you don't like the window theme it uses then you can change them using the GTK+ Preference Tool from http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net/home/index.php/Gtk2Prefs

  *  The Windows executable is a generated using the !ActiveState !PerlApp tool.  It will work provided you do not move or rename the Gtk folder.  If you do, then make sure a Gtk\bin folder is in your system path so it finds the appropriate binaries that it depends on.
