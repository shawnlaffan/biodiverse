#summary Windows binary executable install instructions
#sidebar Installation

*These instructions apply to version 0.17 and later.*
*Note that this executable will not work on Windows 2000 and earlier.*

= Installation =

  *  These instructions assume you have [http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/downloads/list downloaded] and extracted the Biodiverse zip file to your hard drive.  
  *  The following assumes you have unzipped it to `C:\biodiverse`.  If you use a different path then modify the commands below as appropriate.

= Running it =

  *  Biodiverse can be run by double clicking on `C:\biodiverse\BiodiverseGUI.exe`.
    *  Do not use the `BiodiverseGUI.bat` file.  It is used for the source code version.
  *  If you want to keep the command log visible after you close Biodiverse then run it from a command prompt.
    *  Under `Start Menu -> Run` type `cmd`.  
    *  In the resulting command window, type `C:\biodiverse\BiodiverseGUI.exe`.


= Troubleshooting and changes =

  *  The Windows executable is generated using the [https://metacpan.org/pod/pp pp tool].  It will work provided you do not move or rename the Gtk or Gdal folders.  If you do, then make sure their `bin` folders are in your system path so it finds the appropriate binaries that it depends on.  For an example of how to set the path, see http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm.
