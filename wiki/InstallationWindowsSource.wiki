#summary Windows source code install instructions
#sidebar Installation

These instructions apply to version 0.14.

These assume you have saved the Biodiverse source code to C:\biodiverse.  If you have not then change the `C:\biodiverse\lib` in the following to the appropriate directory.

If you don't like the window theme it uses then you can change them using the GTK+ Preference Tool from http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net/home/index.php/Gtk2Prefs

There are two options you can pursue here.  Both will work, but the !CamelBox install uses a more recent perl.

= !ActivePerl = 

== Installation (AS) ==

  * Download the windows executable version for this, as it includes the Gtk binaries.  Alternately, the Gtk binaries can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/downloads/list
  * Unzip the biodiverse directory onto your hard drive. These instructions assume you have placed it in C:\Biodiverse, but it can go anywhere on the file system.
  * Edit your system's PATH variable to include C:\Biodiverse\bin and C:\Biodiverse\gtk\bin.  Make sure the gtk path is before the system perl\bin path, as the trouchelle PPM repository adds incompatible binaries there. For an example of how to set the path, see http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm.
  * Download and install Perl 5.8.925 from http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/5.8.9.827/ActivePerl-5.8.9.827-MSWin32-x86-291969.msi .
  
  * Once that's done, copy and paste the following commands into a command window. These install additional perl libraries needed by Biodiverse.
{{{
ppm repo add http://voltar.org/active/5.8
ppm repo add http://www.biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/ppm
ppm repo add http://trouchelle.com/ppm/
ppm install Bundle-Biodiverse
ppm install Gnome2-Canvas
}}}

== Updating (AS) ==

  *  If you are updating an existing installation then repeat the ppm steps from the installation process.
{{{
ppm repo add http://voltar.org/active/5.8
ppm repo add http://www.biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/ppm
ppm repo add http://trouchelle.com/ppm/
ppm install Bundle-Biodiverse
ppm install Gnome2-Canvas
}}}

== Running it (AS) ==

  *  You should now be able to run Biodiverse by executing `C:\Biodiverse\bin\BiodiverseGUI.bat` (or `C:\Biodiverse\bin\BiodiverseGUI.pl` if your system runs Perl files when they are double clicked).

= !CamelBox =

== Installation (CB) ==

This will require some interaction when it downloads additional packages, depending on your CPAN settings.  

  *  Download and install !CamelBox from http://code.google.com/p/camelbox/ .  Install everything (the "Bloatware - Whole Enchilada" option).  This will install all the Gtk dependencies.
  *  Now you need to install the Biodiverse specific dependencies.  
{{{
sudo perl -MCPAN -Mlib=C:\biodiverse\lib -e 'install Bundle::Biodiverse'
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Gnome2::Canvas'
}}}

== Updating (CB) ==

  *  If you are updating an existing installation then repeat the cpan step from the installation process.
{{{
sudo perl -MCPAN -Mlib=C:\biodiverse\lib -e 'install Bundle::Biodiverse'
}}}

  
== Running it (CB) ==

  * To run Biodiverse, open a terminal window and change directory to the biodiverse\bin folder.  If it is in C:\biodiverse\bin:
{{{
cd C:\biodiverse\bin
}}}
  * Once you have done this, type the following command to open Biodiverse.  This assume you installed !CamelBox into C:\CamelBox, so change the following as necessary.
{{{
C:\CamelBox\bin\perl BiodiverseGUI.pl
}}}
  *  Alternately, you could give the full path to both Perl and Biodiverse if you want to start in a particular directory (i.e. where all your files are).
{{{
C:\CamelBox\bin\perl C:\biodiverse\bin\BiodiverseGUI.pl
}}}


The full path to perl is used to ensure the !CamelBox version is used.

= Trouble shooting =

  *  If you have more than one Perl and/or GTK installed on your system then you need to ensure that the versions you want to use are first in the PATH environment variable.  This is because the CamelBox binaries are not compatible with the ActiveState binaries.  You can manually edit the paths, but it is probably best to create a batch script to do this so it is easy to change things back and forth.
