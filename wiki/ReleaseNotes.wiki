= Version 0.12 =

This version is not yet released.  This is a summary of what will be contained in the release.

  *  The Windows version will come bundled with updated GTK libraries.
  *  All going well, the Mac OSX distribution will come as a DMG installer.
  *  The export interface has been revamped to use two windows.  The first allows the selection of the output format and the second has parameters specific to that format.  This makes the parameter choices clearer as irrelevant parameters are not displayed.  
  *  Feedback to GUI does not contain the line numbers for the code.  They are still printed to the log window, though.
  *  Allow !BaseData, matrix and tree objects to be loaded on startup (previous versions only allowed a project file to be loaded as an argument on startup).
  *  User is warned if they try to add a new spatial or cluster output to a !BaseData and it has one or more randomisations.
  *  Randomisation outputs can now be deleted.
  *  Randomisation outputs now have export methods to generate text files of their initial and current pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state.
  *  The MXO_WARD and TXO_WARD metrics have been removed.  Use the new [http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/wiki/Analyses_and_Indices#Compare_dissimilarity_matrix_values "Compare dissimilarity matrix values"] analysis instead.
  *  Matrix elements (labels) can be remapped on import, as well as excluded/included using the properties table.
  *  The scree plot below the dendrogram is minimised to begin with.  It can be pulled up when needed.

  *  More changes will be listed as they are implemented.
  *  See also http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone-Release0.12


= Version 0.11 =

06Nov2009

Main changes since previous version (0.10).  This is a cleanup and bug fix release with no new features.

  *  Improved feedback and error trapping when running analyses.  If the system fails then a popup window will tell you what went wrong and where.  This information is still printed to the log window so you can access it after closing the popup.
  *  The error trapping also corrects issues where users are unable to close a tab if an analysis fails.  
  *  Basedata imports fail with a warning when they reach a record with an undefined or non-numeric value to be used for the groups (unless it is a text group).  The user can set an option to skip these records (this is on by default).
  *  System warns user when trying to export a randomisation output.  These cannot currently be exported (although the PRNG state would be useful).  The results can be exported from the relevant spatial or cluster output.  See [KeyConcepts#Randomisations]
  *  Exports for spatial outputs, groups and labels now have an option to specify the type of file instead of relying on the file extension for this.  This does not change the possibilities, but does make them clearer.



= Version 0.10 =

21Oct2009

Main changes since previous version (0.9.1185)

  *  Phylogenetic endemism indices are now in the main distribution.  For the theory and some examples, see [http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04311.x Rosauer, Laffan et al. (2009) Molecular Ecology]
  *  Basedata objects now import from matrix format files, eg site by species matrices.  These are a common data format for specimen data.
  *  Documentation is moving to the Google Code wiki site.  http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/w/list
  *  Renaming of basedata and outputs is now possible in the GUI
  *  Users can now specify a definition query to control the groups used in an analysis.  This uses the same syntax as the spatial neighbourhoods.  See http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/wiki/KeyConcepts#Definition_Queries
  *  Option to show/hide the spatial neighbour and definition query edit boxes in the spatial and cluster tabs.  This frees up screen real estate but does not disable them.
  *  Spatial parameters:
    * sp_circle now has an axes argument to control the axes used (default is still to use all axes)
    * New subroutine `sp_match_text (text => 'blah', axis => 0, type => 'proc')`
    * New subroutine `sp_annulus (inner_radius => 100000, outer_radius => 300000)`
    * See http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/wiki/SpatialConditions for examples.
  *  The Biodiverse icon is now used in all versions (previously was only the exe version)
  *  The version numbering system now excludes the SVN revision number.
  *  Numerous bug fixes - see http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3A%27release0.10%27
  *  Some minor speed-ups and smaller memory footprint in some cases

= Version 0.9.1185 =

Main changes since previous release (version 0.9.1127)

  * Installation instructions updated, particularly for the Mac installs.
  * Fixed bug in tree reading module.  Now correctly reads nexus format files, including those exported from Biodiverse.
  * Documentation updated. 
  * Example files added to distribution (data folder)
  * !BaseData import now handles text with embedded newlines (these occur occasionally in plant and other data bases, usually in the collection descriptions).
  * Statistics::Descriptive2 now included in the distribution (under the lib folder)
  * Fixed issue where saved project file is given the name "1.bps"
