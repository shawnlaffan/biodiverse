= Version 0.13 =

This version is in development.  A summary of changes is below.  

  *  The use of the term "analyses" in the documentation is now clearer.  Analyses can be one of Cluster, Spatial or Randomisation.  The term "calculation" is now used to describe the collection of indices that are calculated together, e.g. for the groups in a cluster node or in a spatial neighbourhood.  An analysis can apply several calculations to generate some number of indices.
  *  The endemism calculations have been split.  The lists are now in their own calculations, and need to be called explicitly if needed.
  *  Two new rarity calculations have been added to generate the lists of weights and sample counts for each label used, as per the endemism calculations.
  *  View labels tab:
    *  The view labels lists now have additional columns to allow sorting based on the selections (i.e. to promote the selected set to the top of the list).  Note that the list order changes dynamically according to the sort options.  This means that the list will be reordered if the label selection is changed and there is a sort in place using one or both of these columns.
    *  The second view labels list is only shown if there is a selected matrix.  This is because it is used to show the matrix column selection and control their sort order.
    *  The map legend is now shown in the view labels map pane.  This allows easier interpretation of the mapped values.
  *  Nexus file import is now more flexible in the characters it accepts in names (anything that has no special meaning in nexus files, and also numeric formats used for lengths.
  *  When displaying the cluster dendrogram, the user can choose not to use the slider bar to select nodes to plot on the map (acess via the dendrogram Options menu).
  *  The system now warns if the user attempts to create a new output, or rename an existing output, using a name that is already in use for that output type.  See issue #62.

  *  For a full list of current or fixed issues, see http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone-Release0.13

= Version 0.12 =

07Dec2009

Main changes since the previous version (0.11) are:

  *  The Windows version comes bundled with updated GTK libraries, and the executable version does not require any additional downloads.  (We are still working on an easy Mac install).
  *  The export interface has been revamped to use two windows.  The first allows the selection of the output format and the second has parameters specific to that format.  This makes the parameter choices clearer as irrelevant parameters are not displayed.  
  *  Feedback to GUI does not contain the line numbers for the code.  They are still printed to the log window, though.
  *  Allow native format !BaseData, matrix and tree files to be loaded on startup (previous versions only allowed a project file to be loaded as an argument on startup).
  *  User is warned if they try to add a new spatial or cluster output to a !BaseData and it has one or more randomisations.
  *  Randomisation outputs can now be deleted.
  *  Randomisation outputs now have export methods to generate text files of their initial and current pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state.
  *  The MXO_WARD and TXO_WARD metrics have been removed.  Use the new [http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/wiki/Indices#Compare_dissimilarity_matrix_values "Compare dissimilarity matrix values"] analysis instead.
  *  Matrix elements (labels) can be remapped on import, as well as excluded/included using the properties table.
  *  The scree plot below the dendrogram is minimised to begin with.  It can be pulled up when needed.

  *  See also http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone-Release0.12


= Version 0.11 =

06Nov2009

Main changes since previous version (0.10).  This is a cleanup and bug fix release with no new features.

  *  Improved feedback and error trapping when running analyses.  If the system fails then a popup window will tell you what went wrong and where.  This information is still printed to the log window so you can access it after closing the popup.
  *  The error trapping also corrects issues where users are unable to close a tab if an analysis fails.  
  *  Basedata imports fail with a warning when they reach a record with an undefined or non-numeric value to be used for the groups (unless it is a text group).  The user can set an option to skip these records (this is on by default).
  *  System warns user when trying to export a randomisation output.  These cannot currently be exported (although the PRNG state would be useful).  The results can be exported from the relevant spatial or cluster output.  See [KeyConcepts#Randomisations]
  *  Exports for spatial outputs, groups and labels now have an option to specify the type of file instead of relying on the file extension for this.  This does not change the possibilities, but does make them clearer.



= Version 0.10 =

21Oct2009

Main changes since previous version (0.9.1185)

  *  Phylogenetic endemism indices are now in the main distribution.  For the theory and some examples, see [http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04311.x Rosauer, Laffan et al. (2009) Molecular Ecology]
  *  Basedata objects now import from matrix format files, eg site by species matrices.  These are a common data format for specimen data.
  *  Documentation is moving to the Google Code wiki site.  http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/w/list
  *  Renaming of basedata and outputs is now possible in the GUI
  *  Users can now specify a definition query to control the groups used in an analysis.  This uses the same syntax as the spatial neighbourhoods.  See http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/wiki/KeyConcepts#Definition_Queries
  *  Option to show/hide the spatial neighbour and definition query edit boxes in the spatial and cluster tabs.  This frees up screen real estate but does not disable them.
  *  Spatial parameters:
    * sp_circle now has an axes argument to control the axes used (default is still to use all axes)
    * New subroutine `sp_match_text (text => 'blah', axis => 0, type => 'proc')`
    * New subroutine `sp_annulus (inner_radius => 100000, outer_radius => 300000)`
    * See http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/wiki/SpatialConditions for examples.
  *  The Biodiverse icon is now used in all versions (previously was only the exe version)
  *  The version numbering system now excludes the SVN revision number.
  *  Numerous bug fixes - see http://code.google.com/p/biodiverse/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3A%27release0.10%27
  *  Some minor speed-ups and smaller memory footprint in some cases

= Version 0.9.1185 =

Main changes since previous release (version 0.9.1127)

  * Installation instructions updated, particularly for the Mac installs.
  * Fixed bug in tree reading module.  Now correctly reads nexus format files, including those exported from Biodiverse.
  * Documentation updated. 
  * Example files added to distribution (data folder)
  * !BaseData import now handles text with embedded newlines (these occur occasionally in plant and other data bases, usually in the collection descriptions).
  * Statistics::Descriptive2 now included in the distribution (under the lib folder)
  * Fixed issue where saved project file is given the name "1.bps"
