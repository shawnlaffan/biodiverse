 1. [http://www.biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/outputs_tab_listing_available_data_sets.png Outputs tab listing available data sets]. Several data sets can be stored in a project.
 1. [http://www.biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/view_labels_tab_with_matrix_and_taxonomic_tree.png View labels tab with matrix and taxonomic tree]. Selecting a set of labels (species) highlights them on the map, the tree and the matrix.
 1. [http://www.biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/spatial_analysis_tab_with_subset_visible.png Spatial analysis tab with subset visible]. A large number of spatial calculations can be selected and the neighbourhoods can be arbitrarily complex. Users can incorporate their own calculations using additional libraries.
 1. [http://www.biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/spatial_analysis_coloured_by_CWE.png Spatial analysis coloured by Corrected Weighted Endemism (CWE)]. Results can be plotted with overlain shapefiles.
 1. [http://www.biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/cluster_analysis_tab_with_subset_visible.png Cluster analyses can be conducted to aggregate groups (normally cells) using a user extendable set of functions, optionally with a set of spatial constraints]. The groups under each resulting cluster node can then also be analysed spatially.
