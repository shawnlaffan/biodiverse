= Introduction =

*Site Pair Sampler* is an add-on script for _Biodiverse_, to sample compositional dissimilarity between pair of sites.  Designed for use with Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM) or other models of compositional turnover.

It was written by Dan Rosauer to implement analyses in:
Dan F. Rosauer, Simon Ferrier, Kristen J. Williams, Glenn Manion, J. Scott Keogh and Shawn W. Laffan. _Phylogenetic generalised dissimilarity modelling: a new approach to analysing and predicting spatial turnover in the phylogenetic composition of communities_; which is currently in review with the journal _Ecography_.

= Details =
It is found in the source code version of _Biodiverse_ in:
/biodiverse/etc/site_pair_sampler

Edit a parameter script like the examples found in /biodiverse/etc/site_pair_sampler/bin/

When run, it calls GD_Modeller.pm and other components of _Biodiverse_.

Further detail on the functions of Site Pair Sampler and how to use them, coming soon.
