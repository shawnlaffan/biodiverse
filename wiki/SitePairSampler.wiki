= Introduction =

*Site Pair Sampler* is an add-on script for _Biodiverse_, to sample compositional dissimilarity between pair of sites.  Designed for use with Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM) or other models of compositional turnover.

It was written by Dan Rosauer to implement analyses in:
Dan F. Rosauer, Simon Ferrier, Kristen J. Williams, Glenn Manion, J. Scott Keogh and Shawn W. Laffan. _Phylogenetic generalised dissimilarity modelling: a new approach to analysing and predicting spatial turnover in the phylogenetic composition of communities_; which is currently in review with the journal _Ecography_.

Dan F. Rosauer1,2*, Simon Ferrier3, Kristen J. Williams3, Glenn Manion4, J. Scott Keogh5 and Shawn W. Laffan1


It is found in the source code version of _Biodiverse_ in:
/biodiverse/etc/site_pair_sampler

= Details =
Edit a parameter script like the examples found in /biodiverse/etc/site_pair_sampler/bin/

When run, it calls GD_Modeller.pm and other components of _Biodiverse_.
